    <p>
      Grand Theft Auto V is an open-world action-adventure game set in the
      sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas, blending elements
      of crime, exploration, and storytelling.<br />
      Players control three distinct characters—Michael, Franklin, and
      Trevor—each with their own unique abilities and story arcs, as they
      navigate a world filled with heists, criminal activities, and a satirical
      take on modern life.<br />
      With its rich narrative, expansive multiplayer mode, and detailed
      environment, GTA V has become one of the best-selling video games of all
      time, receiving widespread acclaim for its gameplay and design.
