      The Legend of Zelda is an action-adventure game for the NES that
      introduced players to the fantasy world of Hyrule, where they control the
      hero Link on a quest to rescue Princess Zelda and defeat the evil
      Ganon.<br />
      The game is notable for its open-world exploration, challenging dungeons,
      and the innovative use of items like bombs, boomerangs, and the iconic
      Master Sword.<br />
      With its non-linear gameplay, puzzle-solving, and memorable music, The
      Legend of Zelda became a groundbreaking title, laying the foundation for
      one of the most beloved franchises in gaming history.
