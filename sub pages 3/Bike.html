    <p>
      Excite Bike is a classic motocross racing game for the NES, where players
      race against time and opponents on challenging tracks filled with jumps,
      obstacles, and hazards.<br />
      The game allows players to control the speed and balance of their bike,
      with a focus on avoiding overheating and strategically using ramps to gain
      speed.<br />
      With its simple yet addictive game play and a track editor that lets
      players create their own courses, Excite Bike became one of the standout
      titles in early NES history.
