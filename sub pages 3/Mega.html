    <p>
      Mega Man 2 is a beloved action-platformer for the NES, where players
      control the heroic robot Mega Man as he battles through stages filled with
      enemies and bosses created by the evil Dr. Wily.<br />
      Each stage is themed around a unique Robot Master, and upon defeating
      them, Mega Man gains their special weapon, which can be used to strategize
      in future battles.<br />
      Known for its challenging gameplay, iconic music, and tight controls, Mega
      Man 2 is often hailed as one of the greatest games in the Mega Man series
      and a classic of the NES era.
